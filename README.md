# Implement_Dimensionality_Reduction_using_PCA_and_t_SNE
🧮 Project Description

This project focuses on implementing Dimensionality Reduction techniques using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) — two of the most powerful methods in Machine Learning and Data Visualization.

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of input features while preserving essential information from the dataset. It helps improve model efficiency, training speed, and data interpretability.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a linear technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system, maximizing variance along principal components. It is ideal for feature extraction and noise reduction.

t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a non-linear technique used mainly for high-dimensional data visualization, preserving local structure and revealing hidden patterns in data.

This project demonstrates how both PCA and t-SNE can be applied to real-world datasets for feature reduction and 2D/3D visualization, highlighting their differences in computational behavior and visual outcomes.
